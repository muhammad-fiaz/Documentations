## Welcome to the Docs Contribution Guide!

We’re excited to have you here and appreciate your interest in contributing to our documentation. This guide will help you get started with editing and improving the docs, making them a valuable resource for everyone.

### Why Contribute?

Open-source work is a team effort, and documentation is no exception. Contributing to docs is a great way for beginners to get involved and for experienced developers to share their expertise. By improving the documentation, you’re helping to build a stronger, more accessible resource for all users.

### How to Contribute

The documentation is stored in our repository. You can contribute by editing files directly on GitHub or cloning the repo to make changes locally.

#### GitHub Workflow

If you’re new to GitHub, check out the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) to learn how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.

**Note:** The docs code is synced from a private codebase to the public repository. While you won’t be able to preview the docs locally, your changes will appear on the site once your pull request is merged.

### Writing MDX

Our documentation is written in MDX, combining markdown with JSX syntax. This allows embedding React components in the docs. For markdown basics, refer to the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

#### VSCode Setup

To preview MDX files in VSCode, follow these steps:

1. Open the command palette (`⌘ + ⇧ + P` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows) and select **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
2. Add this line to your `settings.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "files.associations": {
        "*.mdx": "markdown"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Use the command palette to select **Markdown: Preview File** or **Markdown: Open Preview to the Side**.

#### Recommended Extensions

- **MDX:** Provides IntelliSense and syntax highlighting for MDX.
- **Prettier:** Formats MDX files on save.

### Review Process

Once you submit a contribution, our team will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request when it's ready. If you have questions, use the PR comments.

**Tip:** Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to format your code before submitting your PR.

### File Structure

Our docs use file-system routing. Each folder and file in `/docs` represents a route segment for URLs, navigation, and breadcrumbs.

For example, to contribute to "Authentication," place the file in:

```
/docs/authentication.mdx
```

### Metadata

Each page begins with a metadata block:

**Required Fields:**

- `title`: The page's `<h1>` title, used for SEO and OG Images.
- `description`: A brief summary, used in the `<meta>` tag for SEO.

Example metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Authentication
description: How to configure authentication.
---
```

**Optional Fields:**

- `nav_title`: Overrides the page's title in navigation.
- `source`: Includes shared content from another source.
- `related`: Lists related pages at the document's end.

### Page Types

Docs are categorized as:

- **Conceptual Pages:** Explain ideas or features in detail. Found in `/docs/concepts`.
- **Reference Pages:** Detail APIs or functions. Found in `/docs/reference`.

### Style Guide

**Voice and Tone:**

- Be clear and concise.
- Use active voice and avoid jargon.
- Keep language simple and avoid subjective terms.

**Code Blocks:**

- Include working examples.
- Use language-specific headers (e.g., `tsx`, `jsx`).
- Highlight key lines for clarity.

**Icons:**  
Use provided icons for consistency.

### Custom Components and HTML

We use React components like `<Image />` and `<Check />` in the docs. Avoid raw HTML, except for `<details>`.
