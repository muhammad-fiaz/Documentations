### Utilize Log Levels Effectively

Use appropriate log levels for different types of messages to make your logs more meaningful:
- **`INFO`**: General information about the application’s state.
- **`WARN`**: Potential issues or important events that may need attention.
- **`ERROR`**: Error messages that indicate something went wrong.
- **`DEBUG`**: Detailed information useful for debugging.
- **`CRITICAL`**: Severe issues that might cause the application to crash.

### Customize Log File Size and Path

Configure the log file size and path to manage disk usage and organize logs:

```python
logly.set_default_file_path("path/to/logfile.txt")
logly.set_default_max_file_size(100)  # Size in MB
```

This helps in keeping log files manageable and directing them to appropriate locations.

### Use Colors Wisely

Use colors to differentiate log levels and make logs more readable:

```python
logly.info("Informational message", color=logly.COLOR.GREEN)
logly.error("Error message", color=logly.COLOR.RED)
```

Be mindful of color usage, especially if logs are intended for environments where color might not be visible (e.g., plain text logs).

### Disable Color for Production

For production environments, it might be useful to disable colors to avoid issues with log readability:

```python
logly.color_enabled = False
```

### Manage Timestamps

Control whether timestamps are included in your logs:

```python
logly.show_time = True  # Enable timestamps
logly.show_time = False  # Disable timestamps
```

This can be useful for both development and production environments depending on your logging needs.

### Handle Log Overflow

Ensure that log files do not become excessively large by setting a maximum file size. This helps in rotating logs and preventing disk space issues:

```python
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)  # Size in MB
```

### Regularly Review Logs

Periodically review logs to monitor application performance and identify any potential issues early.

### Use Log Rotation

For long-running applications, consider implementing log rotation to handle large volumes of logs and maintain performance.

### Keep Logs Secure

Ensure that logs containing sensitive information are securely stored and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.

### Explore Logging Libraries

While Logly is a great tool, don’t hesitate to explore other logging libraries that may offer additional features or integrations suitable for your needs.
