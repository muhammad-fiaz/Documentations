<Steps>

### Import Logly

First, import the `Logly` class from the `logly` module:

```python
from logly import Logly
```

### Create a Logly Instance

Create an instance of `Logly`:

```python
logly = Logly()
```

### Start Logging

Initialize logging and start logging messages:

```python
logly.start_logging()
```

### Log Messages

You can log messages with different levels and colors:

```python
logly.info("This is an info message")
logly.warn("This is a warning message", color=logly.COLOR.YELLOW)
logly.error("This is an error message", color=logly.COLOR.RED)
logly.debug("This is a debug message", color=logly.COLOR.BLUE)
logly.critical("This is a critical message", color=logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.fatal("This is a fatal message", color=logly.COLOR.CRITICAL)
logly.trace("This is a trace message", color=logly.COLOR.BLUE)
```

### Stop Logging

To stop logging and prevent further messages from being saved:

```python
logly.stop_logging()
```

### Log More Messages

You can log additional messages after stopping logging, but they won’t be saved to the file:

```python
logly.info("This message will be displayed but not saved to file")
```

### Custom File Path and Size

Set a custom file path and max file size for logging:

```python
logly.set_default_file_path("custom_log.txt")
logly.set_default_max_file_size(50)  # Size in MB
```

### Disable Color

If you want to disable color output for logging:

```python
logly.color_enabled = False
logly.info("This message will not use color")
```

### Enable/Disable Timestamp

You can enable or disable timestamps in log messages:

```python
logly.show_time = False  # Disable timestamps
logly.info("This message will not include a timestamp")

logly.show_time = True   # Enable timestamps
logly.info("This message will include a timestamp")
```

### Access Color Constants

Use predefined color constants for log messages:

```python
logly.info("Message with red color", color=logly.COLOR.RED)
```

### Display Logged Messages

To display all logged messages:

```python
print("Logged Messages:")
for message in logly.logged_messages:
    print(message)
```

### Example Usage

Here’s a complete example of using Logly in a script:

```python
from logly import Logly

logly = Logly()
logly.start_logging()

logly.info("Application started")
logly.warn("This is a warning")
logly.error("An error occurred", color=logly.COLOR.RED)

logly.stop_logging()

logly.info("This message won't be logged to file")

logly.start_logging()
logly.info("Logging resumed")
```

</Steps>

These Steps will help you get started with logging in your Python application using Logly. For more advanced features and customization options, refer to the [Logly documentation](https://fiaz.dev/docs/logly).
