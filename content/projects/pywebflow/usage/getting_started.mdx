## Getting Started with PyWebflow

Follow these steps to install and integrate **PyWebflow** into your Python projects.

### 1. Install PyWebflow

Ensure PyWebflow is installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pywebflow
```

### 2. Import PyWebflow

Once installed, import the module into your Python script:

```python
import pywebflow
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```python
import webflow
```

Both work identically.

### 3. Using an Alias

For better readability and maintainability, you can assign a custom alias:

```python
import pywebflow as pwf
```

or

```python
import webflow as wf
```

### 4. Verify Installation

To confirm that PyWebflow is installed correctly, run the following in a Python shell:

```python
import pywebflow
print(pywebflow.__version__)
```

This should display the installed version.

### 5. Next Steps

Now that PyWebflow is set up, you can start building flow-based applications.
